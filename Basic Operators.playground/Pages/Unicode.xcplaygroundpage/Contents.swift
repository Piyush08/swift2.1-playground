//: ## Unicode
//: _Unicode_ is an international standard for encoding, representing and processing text in different writing systems. It enables you to represent almost any character from any language in a standardize form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page.
//: ### Unicode Scalar
/*: 
Behind the scenes, Swift's native `String` type is built from _Unicode scalar_ values. A Unicode scalar is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as `U+0061` for `LATIN SMALL LETTER A` (`"a"`), or `U+1F425` for `FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK` (`"üê•"`)

Unicode scalar is a unique 21-bit number for a character

//: ### Special Characters in String Literals
"\0" // null character
"\\(multiplier)" // backslash
"\t" // horizontal tab
"\n" // line feed
"\r" // carriage return
"\"" // double quote
"\'" // single quote
"\u{1F396}"
//: ### Extended Grapheme Clusters
//: Every instance of Swift's `Character` type represents a single _extended grapheme cluster_. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.
