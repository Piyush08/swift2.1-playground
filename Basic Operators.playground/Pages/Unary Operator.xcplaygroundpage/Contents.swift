//: Previous [Remainder Operator](@previous)
//: ### Unary Minus Operator
//: The sign of numeric value can be toggled using a prefixed `-`. It is prepended directly before the value it operates on, without any white space.
let three = 3
let minusThree = -three // minus three
let plusThree = -minusThree // plus three
//: ### Unary Plus Operator
//: Simply returns the value it operates on, without any changes. Although the unary plus operator doesn't actually do anything, you can use it to provide symmetry in your code for positive numbers when also using the unary minus operator for negative numbers
var minusSix = -6
let alsoMinusSix = +minusSix
