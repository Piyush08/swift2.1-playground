//: ## Global and Local Variables
/*:
The capabilities describe above for computing and observing properties are also available to _global variables_ and _local variables_. Global variables are variables that are defined outside of any function, method, closure or type context. Local variable are variables that are defined within a function, method, or closure context.
Global constants and variable are always computed lazily, in a similar manner to Lazy Stored Properties. Unlike lazy stored properties, global constants and variables do not need to be marked with the `lazy` modifier.
