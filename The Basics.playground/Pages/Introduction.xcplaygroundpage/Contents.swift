//: # The Basics
/*: Swift is a new programming language for iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS app development.
* Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types, including `Int` for integers, `Double` and `Float` for floating-point values, `Bool` for Boolean values, String for textual data.
* Provides powerful versions of the three primary collection types, `Array`, `Set`, and `Dictionary`
* Swift makes extensive use of variables whose values cannot be changed. These are known as constants and are much more powerful than constants in C.
* Swift introduces advanced types not found in Objective-C, such as tuples. Tuples enable you to create and pass around groupings of values.
* Constants are used throughout Swift to make code safer and clearer in intent when you work with values that do not need to change
* You can use tuples to return multiple values from a function as a single compound value
* Swift introduces optional types, which handles the absence of a value.
* Optionals say either “there is a value, and it equals x” or “there isn’t a value at all”
* Using optionals is similar to using nil with pointers in Objective-C, but they work for any type, not just classes. Not only are optionals safer and more expressive than nil pointers in Objective-C, they are at the heart of many of Swift’s most powerful features.
* Swift is a **type-safe** language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with.
* If part of your code expects a `String`, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake.
* Likewise, type safety prevents you from accidentally passing an optional `String` to a piece of code that expects a non-optional String. Type safety helps you catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process
