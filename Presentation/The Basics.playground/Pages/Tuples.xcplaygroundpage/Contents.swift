//: # Tuples
//: _Tuples_ groupd multiple values into a single compound value. The values with a tuple can be of any type and do not have to be of the same type as each other

//: You can _decompose_ a tuple's contents into separate constants or variables, which you then access as usual

//: If you only need some of the tuple's values, ignore parts of the tuple with an underscore (_) when you decompose the tuple

//: Access the individual element values in a tuple using index numbers starting zero

//: You can name the individual elements in a tuple when the tuple is defined

/*: 
Tuples are particulary useful as the return values of functions. A function that tries to retrieve a web page might return the `(Int, String)` tuple type to describe the success or failure of the page retrieval.
