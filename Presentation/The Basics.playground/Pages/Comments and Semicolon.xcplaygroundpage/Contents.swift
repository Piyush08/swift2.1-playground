//: Previous [Constants and Variables](@previous)
//: # Comments
//: Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//)

//: Multiline comments starts with a forward-slash followed by an askterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/)

//: Unlike multiline comments in C, multiline comments in Swift can be nested inside other multiline comments. You write nested comments by starting a multiline comment block and then starting a second multiline comment within the first block. The second block is then closed, followed by the first block:

//: ## Semicolon
//: Swift does not required you to write a semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish. However, semicolons _are_ required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line

//: Move on to [Integers and Floating-point numbers](@next)
